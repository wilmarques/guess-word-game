### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow #file:../../.github/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md
You WILL systematically implement #file:../plans/20250823-flutter-web-initialization-upgrade-plan.instructions.md task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions

**CRITICAL**: If ${input:phaseStop:true} is true, you WILL stop after each Phase for user review.
**CRITICAL**: If ${input:taskStop:false} is true, you WILL stop after each Task for user review.

### Step 3: Cleanup
