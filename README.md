# Guess Word Game

A Flutter built game where you have to guess the word when given its definition.

## Run in GitHub Codespaces

This repo includes a dev container that sets up Flutter (web-first) for Codespaces.

- Dev container uses the Desktop Lite feature and auto-forwards:
  - 8080: Flutter web server (label: flutter-web)

- VS Code launch configs are prepared for web; if debugging fails to detect Dart, ensure the Dart and Flutter extensions are enabled.

Steps (per GitHub Codespaces docs):

1. Open this repo in a Codespace.
2. Wait for the dev container to build and post-create steps to finish.
3. Launch the App using Launch on VSCode (press F5)
